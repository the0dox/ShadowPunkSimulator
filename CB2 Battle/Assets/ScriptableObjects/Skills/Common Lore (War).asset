  displayText: The Common Lore skill is used to recall the  habits, institutions,
    traditions, public figures  100 and superstitions of a particular world,  cultural
    group, organisation or race. This Skill does not represent scholarly learning 
    (that is Scholastic Lore), nor obscure  forbidden knowledge (that is Forbidden 
    Lore). So long as the subject of your investigation falls within a category of
    Lore your trained in, it can be used as an investigation skill. When used this
    way, investigation time is reduced by an additional 1d5 hours.
