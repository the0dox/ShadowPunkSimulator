  displayText: THe Secret Tongue skill is used to speak and  comprehend a particularly
    obscure and  arcane language known to only those of  a specific profession. This
    skill doesn't need to be tested, only to decipher complicated communications.
    In all other cases, owning this skill allows player characters to communicate
    without conveying information to those without the skill.
