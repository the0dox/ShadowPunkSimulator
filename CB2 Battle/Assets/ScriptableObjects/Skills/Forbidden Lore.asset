  - Investigation
  displayText: A character that learns the Forbidden  Lore skill in play, or who
    uses it to  gain some insight into the mysteries of the galaxy, may also gain
    a number of Corruption or Insanity Points,  depending on the danger the knowledge 
    represents. So long as the subject of your investigation falls within a category
    of Lore your trained in, it can be used as an investigation skill. When used
    this way, investigation time is reduced by an additional 1d10 hours.
