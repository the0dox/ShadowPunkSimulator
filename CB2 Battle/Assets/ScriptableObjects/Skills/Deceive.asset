  displayText: The Deceive skill is used to lie and  con others. You make Deceive
    Tests  whenever you would convince others  of something that is not necessarily 
    true, want to dupe them or otherwise  swindle and mislead them. A Deceive Test
    can affect a number  of targets equal to your Fellowship  Bonus and your targets
    must be able  to see and hear you clearly, and  understand what you say. Deceive
    is  typically opposed by Scrutiny.
