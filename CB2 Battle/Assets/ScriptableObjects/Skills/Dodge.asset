  displayText: "You may use the Dodge skill once per Round to negate a successful
    hand-to\x02hand or ranged attack. On a successful  Test, the attack deals no
    Damage. Every degree of success negates an additional attack from a singular
    source (such as full-auto fire) A dodge skill can only be attempted against a
    blast attack if afterwards, you can half move out of the blast radius."
