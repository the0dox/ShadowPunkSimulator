  displayText: 'Sneaking represents your character''s aptitude for evading detection.
    A character can make sneaking checks as a half action during combat or at GM
    discretion outside of combat. Sneaking cannot be attempted when an enemy has
    any form of line of sight on you. When you attempt to move through the detection
    radius of an enemy, they must make a perception check with a threshold equal
    to your hits on the stealth roll in order to detect you. '
