  displayText: You can use the Security skill to bypass  locks and other security
    systems. The  Difficulty of the Test depends on the  quality of the defence.
    Generally one  Test is sufficient, but more complicated  systems may require
    additional Tests or  degrees of success. A Security Test takes one minute,  with
    each degree of success reducing  this time by ten seconds
