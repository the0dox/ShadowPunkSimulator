  displayText: The Pilot skill is used to fly anything  from small atmospheric craft
    such as  ornithopters and landers, all the way  up to spaceship-sized vessels.
    Piloting  a ship under normal conditions does  not require a Test. However, Tests
    may  be called for when flying in conditions  such as storms, going at excessive
    speed  or attempting dangerous manoeuvres. When chasing another vehicle, you 
    and your opponent make Opposed  Pilot Tests.
