  - Investigation
  displayText: "You can use Evaluate to determine the  approximate value of everyday
    objects,  as well as valuables such as archeotech  and other objects d\u2019art.
    A successful  Test reveals the item\u2019s market price  and possibly a little
    bit about the item  itself. Since a failed Test may result  in the miscalculation
    of an item\u2019s true  value, it is recommended that the GM  rolls Evaluate
    Tests in secret and tells  the player what his character believes  to be true.
    If you have an object relevant to an investigation, then you can use this skill
    as an investigation skill. When used this way, reduce the time be an additional
    1d5 hours."
