  displayText: "Disguise represents your character\u2019s ability to perform social
    stealth. Disguise can be used to impersonate a specific person, or just hide
    your current identity. The difficulty of a disguise check is contextual to what
    you are attempting to evade. It's easier to blend into a crowd than pose as the
    administrative commissioner of Emerald City"
