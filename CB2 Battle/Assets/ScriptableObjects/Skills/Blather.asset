  displayText: "The Blather skill is always Opposed by your target\u2019s  Willpower
    (or Scrutiny). If you succeed and  the target fails, the target is distracted
    by you  and can do nothing for one Round, staring  dumbfounded and wondering
    if you are  drunk, crazy or both. For every degree of  success, you dumbfound
    the target for an  additional Round. You can affect a number of target equal
    to your Fellowship Bonus. NPC's are not affected if they are in obvious danger.
    A Blather test is a Full Action."
