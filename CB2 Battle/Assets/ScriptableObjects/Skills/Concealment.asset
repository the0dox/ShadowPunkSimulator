  displayText: "Concealment is used whenever you  want to hide from sight. To use
    this  Skill, there must be appropriate terrain  (trees, walls, buildings or some
    other  obstacle) or some concealing effect  like fog or darkness. Otherwise,
    the  test automatically fails. Concealment  is always an Opposed Test, in which 
    you pit your Concealment Test  against your opponent\u2019s Awareness  Test (or
    half their Perception if they  do not have the Awareness skill). You need not
    Test Concealment when you  hide, only when someone is looking for you. If you
    succeed, you remain  unseen. If you remain perfectly still, you gain a  +10 bonus
    to your Test. A Concealment Test is usually a Half Action."
