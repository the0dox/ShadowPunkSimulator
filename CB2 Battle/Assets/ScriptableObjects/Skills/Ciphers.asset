  displayText: The Ciphers Skill reflectes an understanding of shorthand codes employed
    by certain groups to confer basic ideas, warnings and, information about a given
    area. This skill doesn't need to be tested, only to decipher complicated communications.
    In all other cases, owning this skill allows player characters to communicate
    without conveying information to those without the skill.
