  displayText: The Chem-Use skill is used to handle and prepare chemicals  safely,
    especially toxins, poisons and  drugs. Chem-Use covers the use and  manufacture
    of toxins and it can also be  used to identify a variety of chemicals (Investigation
    use). To prepare or apply a chemical, you  must succeed at a Chem-Use Test, with 
    modifiers determined by the GM. On a failed test the chemical is wasted. If you
    fail  by five or more degrees, you accidentally  poison yourself or overdose.
