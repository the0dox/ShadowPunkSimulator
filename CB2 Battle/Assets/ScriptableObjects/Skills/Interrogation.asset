  displayText: The Interrogation Skill is an opposed test against a targets Willpower.
    A success reduces the time of the investigation by double your willpower bonus
    and an additional 1 hour for each degree of success. A failure of 3 degrees deals
    1d10 + WP to the targets, and the target gets a +30 to resist further Interrogation.
