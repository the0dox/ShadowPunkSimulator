  displayText: "The Contortionist skill is used to  wriggle free from bonds, squeeze 
    through a narrow opening, or slip out  of chains. Escape Bonds Whenever you attempt
    to slip free  from any kind of bonds, you make  a Contortionist Test. The Difficulty 
    depends on the Intelligence of the  person who secured you in the first  place.
    If their Intelligence exceeds  your Agility Characteristic, the Test  is Hard
    (\u201320). Escape Grapple When you have been Grappled  in combat, you may use
    the  Contortionist skill to escape. Make  a Contortionist Test opposed by  the
    grappler\u2019s Strength Test. If you  win you break free, otherwise you remain
    Grappled. Squeeze through a Tight Space You can make a Contortionist Test  to
    squeeze through a tight space. failure means that the  opening is too narrow
    after all. If  you fail by five or more degrees,  you become stuck until you
    can pass  a subsequent Contortionist Test or until someone helps you out of your 
    predicament by dragging you out."
