  displayText: "You make Intimidate Tests whenever you  want to coerce or frighten
    individuals  or a small group. You need not make  an Intimidate Test every time
    you make  a threat. Usually Intimidate is backed  up by Strength, but more subtle
    threats  such as blackmail may use Intelligence  or Fellowship at the GM\u2019s
    option. The  more degrees of success, the more  frightened your opponent becomes.
    An Intimidate Test can affect a number  of targets equal to your Strength Bonus, 
    Intelligence Bonus, or Fellowship Bonus,  depending on the Characteristics you 
    are using for your Test. In addition, your  targets must be able to see and hear
    you  clearly, and understand what you say. An Intimidate Test is a Full Action."
