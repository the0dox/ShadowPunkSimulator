  displayText: "The Literacy skill enables you to read any language you can speak.
    You normally do not need to Test Literacy for everyday instances of reading or
    writing, but the GM may call for a Literacy Test when you attempt to read a challenging
    dialect, poor penmanship, decipher obscure phraseology, archaic usage or unusual
    idioms. To read one page of text\u2014 approximately 750 words\u2014a Literacy 
    Test takes about a minute."
