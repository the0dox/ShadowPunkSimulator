  displayText: The Survival skill is used to subsist in the wild. This skill encompasses
    such activities as fishing, finding edible food, constructing shelters.  Failing
    a test indicates you have failed to find what you are looking for. But a failure
    of 3 degrees or more means you have come across something dangerous like triggerring
    a rockslide or eating poisoned berries.
