  displayText: The Drive skill is used to control  autos, trucks, landspeeders and
    other  land-based or hover vehicles. Driving  under normal conditions does not 
    require a Test. However, Tests may be  called for when navigating treacherous 
    terrain, going at excessive speed or  attempting dangerous manoeuvres.  Opposed
    Drive Tests are made between  pursuers and pursued during a chase. Having a vehicle
    will reduce the time of any time-based activity by 1d5 hours.
