  displayText: 'The Acrobatics skill encompasses  a variety of movement techniques 
    unavailable to less flexible Acolytes. From  performing somersaults to tumbling, 
    from flipping through the air to daring  leaps and jumps, this Skill expands
    your  movement options. Disengage: You may make an Acrobatics  Test when attempting
    a Disengage Action  to reduce it to a Half Action. Jumping & Leaping: You may 
    substitute an Acrobatics Test for an  Agility Test when Jumping or Strength 
    Tests when Leaping. An Acrobatics Test is typically a Full  Action'
