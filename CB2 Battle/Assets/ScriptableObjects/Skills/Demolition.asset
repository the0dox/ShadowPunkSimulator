  displayText: 'The Demolition skill is used to blow things up without blowing yourself
    up at the same time! \nManufacture Explosives this skill enables crafting of
    any explosive. \nPlanting Explosives: Explosives are more effective when planted
    on a target. Success indicates  that you have successfully planted the  explosive,
    with a trigger mechanism  and condition of your choice.  Possible triggers include
    timers, fuses,  proximity sensors or remote controls.  Failure indicates that
    you believe the  explosives to be planted properly, but  when triggered they
    fail to go off. If  you fail by five or more degrees, you  accidentally set the
    explosives off  yourself ! Boom! You may voluntarily make the Test  more difficult,
    for example increasing  the time to plant a bomb in a more  vulnerable location.
    By doing so, the  Damage dealt is increased by +2.\n Defusing a bomb: A character
    can also use the Demolition  skill to defuse a bomb. To defuse a  bomb before
    it explodes requires you  to make an Opposed Demolition Test  against the Demolition
    Test of the  character who set the bomb in the first  place. Five or more degrees
    of failure means you accidentally set off the bomb by mistake! A demoltion test
    outside of crafting is a full action.'
