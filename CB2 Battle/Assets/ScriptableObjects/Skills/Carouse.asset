  displayText: The Carouse Skill is used whenever you have to resist the effects
    of alcohol or similar intoxicants. Each time you take a drink or some  other
    form of intoxicant, make a Carouse  Test. Failure indicates you have gained a 
    level of Fatigue. Should you pass out as  a result, you become unconscious for
    a  number of hours equal to 1d10 minus  your Toughness Bonus.
