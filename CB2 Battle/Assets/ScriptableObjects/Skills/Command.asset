  displayText: 'Command is used to make subordinates  follow your orders. You may
    only use this  Skill on those who are under your authority.  A successful Command
    Test indicates  that those whom you direct follow your  instructions. On a failed
    Test, they either  misinterpret the command or do nothing  at all, or if you
    fail by five or more degrees,  contradict your orders entirely. A Command Test
    can affect a number  of targets equal to your Fellowship  Bonus and your targets
    must be able to  see and hear you clearly, and understand  what you say. The
    target of a command check gain a +10, with an additional +5 for each degree of
    success to the next skill they attempt. A Command Test is a Half Action for 
    simple commands and a Full Action for  more involved instructions. '
