  description: 'Samurai are known to be able to push their bodies beyond their physical
    limit,  gaining bursts of power at a great cost.


    You gain the ''Adrenaline''
    action. As a free action you can immediately make another attack with your weapon
    ignoring the one attack per turn restriction. Taking this action gives you the
    ''winded'' condition that reduces your next initative roll by 10.'
