    ''Momentum''
    is a free action where the adept makes an acrobatics check to preform a movement
    trick described by the player. The threshold can be made easier or harder depending
    on the senario. If successful, the adept enters a state of momentum, a defensive
    buff that can be spent on special adept manuevers'
