  description: 'Certain adepts prefer a hit an run style of combat, using their superior
    agility to dart in and out of combat.


    Reposition is a free action that
    can only be used while in a state of momentum. Reposition expends your momentum
    to allow you to move after you make an attack action this turn (normally you
    are unable to move after an attack action)'
