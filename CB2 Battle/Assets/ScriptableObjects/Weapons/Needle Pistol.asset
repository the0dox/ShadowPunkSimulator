  description: Needle pistols use a low-power laser beam to propel small slivers
    of crystalline coated in viral toxins. Enemies wounded by them are almost instantly
    paralysed or dead within moments. As they are virtually silent and have no muzzle
    flash, needle weapons are ideal for assassins.
