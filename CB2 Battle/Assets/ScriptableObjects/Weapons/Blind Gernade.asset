  description: "Blind grenades explode with a burst of dense smoke, IR bafflers and
    broadband EM\x02spectrum chaff, all of which is designed to block detection through
    the cloud. Sensors and vision that would pierce normal smoke cannot see through
    haze created by a blind grenade. In calm conditions the cloud of smoke is roughly
    3m wide and 2m tall and lasts 3 Rounds. In high winds this may be reduced."
