  description: Favoured by snipers, the long las is a specially modified version 
    of the lasgun constructed for added range and accuracy. As its  name implies,
    a long las also has a much longer barrel than  a lasgun, sometimes being up to
    twice the length, making it  unwieldy in close quarters
