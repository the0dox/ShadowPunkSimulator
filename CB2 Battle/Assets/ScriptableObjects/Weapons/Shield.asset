  description: "Shields are a useful protective device, either in conjunction  with
    armour or on their own. They can be made from a  variety of materials, ranging
    from improvised wooden or  plastic sheets to advanced metal or armourplas plates.
    Sizes  can range from light bucklers to huge full-body shields as  large as a
    man. As they are intended for defence, attacking  with a shield imposes a \u201320
    penalty"
