  description: Even the lowest-tech factories can produce these weapons,  making
    them a common sight in the galaxy. Favoured for  urban and shipboard combat,
    where their short-range  stopping power comes into play, shotguns have found
    their  way into the arsenal of many Imperial organisations.
