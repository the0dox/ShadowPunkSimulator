  description: Data-slates are commonplace in the Imperium, as the primary  means
    of storing and reading printed text and other media such  as video or audio recordings.
    They are so cheap and easy to  make that many contain a single media recording,
    such as text,  and can only play that single file. Others can re-record new 
    information, and transmit and receive data from other devices
